Complete the steering wheel

_Note that this is only required for cars that will be operated by hand._

## Procedure

1. Replace the remaining seven (7) screws in the steering wheel and tighten them.

## Verification

Use the multimeter to test the wiring.
1. On the multimeter, select "Ohms" (or continuity).
2. Place the red lead of the meter on the bare wire of the red wire.
3. Place the black lead of the meter on the bare wire of the black wire.
4. With both leads touching their respective wires:
	1. The meter should not show continuity.
	2. Depress the push button, and the meter should indicate continuity (by showing zero or almost zero ohms or beeping).

After you confirm that steering wheel is completely assembled and that the wiring is correct, you can continue to the [next task]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/cars-maserati-task10.html).
