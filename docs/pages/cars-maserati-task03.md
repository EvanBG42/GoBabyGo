Disconnect the battery 

_Note: the battery may already be disconnected._ If you think that the battery is disconnected, skip to the **Verification** step below to be sure.

## Procedure

**NOTE:** If the seat is installed, remove the seat.

The battery is the black, rectangular object located under the seat and towards the rear of the car. It provides power to the car through the red/orange connectors; (#1) in this photo.

	1. Locate the locking tab on the connector (#1) and with your fingernail, press it in the direction indicated by the arrow. Note that the connector is difficult to separate.
	2. **DO NOT PULL ON THE WIRES!** <br />Pull only on the red-orange connector shells.
	2. With the locking tab pressed, pull the two connector shells apart.

4. Put the connector on the battery cable (the connector with the locking tab) behind battery in the space shown by #2 in the photo. <br />![Battery disconnected]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task03-002.jpg)
