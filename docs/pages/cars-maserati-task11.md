Install the toggle switch assembly.

_Note that this is only required for cars that will be operated by hand._

## Procedure

TBA

## Verification
Use the multimeter to test the wiring.
1. Select "Ohms" (or continuity) on the meter.
2. At the end of the 18-ga duplex wire that's not connected to the switch: 
	2. Place the red lead of the meter on the bare wire of the red wire.
	3. Place the black lead of the meter on the bare wire of the black wire.
4. With both leads are touching their respective wires:
	1. With the switch in the OFF position, the meter should not show continuity.
	2. With the switch in the OFF position, the meter should indicate continuity (by showing zero or almost zero ohms or beeping).

After you confirm that toggle switch is wired correctly, you can continue to the [next task]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/cars-maserati-task12.html).
