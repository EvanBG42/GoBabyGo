Reassemble the modified steering wheel

_Note that this is only required for cars that will be operated by hand._

## Procedure 

1. Twist the red and black wires together slightly
2. Taper the gray insulation of the 18-ga duplex wire at the free end of the wire
2. Insert the twisted wires through the hole in the steering wheel base
3. Pull the wire through as you close the steering wheel cover on to the base. 
	1. Be careful to align the spokes of the steering wheel cover to those of the base.
	2. Be careful to not pull too hard on the 18-ga duplex wire as that might disconnect the wire from the push button
3. When the cover is fitted to the base, insert three (3) screws evenly around the ring of the steering wheel
4. Untwist the red and black wires so they are separate, again.
5. Use the crimping tool to attach a red, male crimp terminals to the red wire and the black wire.
6. After attaching the red, male terminals, gently tug them to make sure they are attached.

## Verification

Use the multimeter to test the wiring.
1. Select "Ohms" (or continuity)
2. Place the red lead of the meter on the metal terminal of the red wire
3. Place the black lead of the meter on the metal terminal of the black wire
4. With both leads are touching their respective terminals:
	1. The meter should not show continuity
	2. Depress the push button, and the meter should indicate continuity (by showing zero or almost zero ohms or beeping)

After you confirm that the wiring is correct with the multimeter, you can continue to the [next task]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/cars-maserati-task09.html).
