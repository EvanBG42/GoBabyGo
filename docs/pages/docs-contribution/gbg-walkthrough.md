This is a walkthrough for the entire contribution process: from finding an issue through submitting a pull request.

## Finding an Issue

The test version of the Go Baby Go website is located at [Dr. Watson's Personal account](https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo). From there, click the _Issues_ tab.

From there, you can sort the issues via the tags they are associated with. A more detailed description of the tags is available on the issues page [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/docs-contribution/gbg-issues.html).

After selecting an issue, be sure that your chosen issue is not already being worked on by someone else! Type a comment on your issue to let others know that you've claimed it.

Once you've claimed your issue, you are ready to fork the repository.

## Forking the Repo

We highly recommend new users work with the GitHub desktop program. It can be downloaded [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

To fork the repository, simply click the fork button in the top right of the repository web page.

Once this is done, you will have a copy of the repository tied to your account. From here, you can clone the repository and begin work.

## Making Changes

To make changes, edit or create files that correspond with the section you are attempting to correct. Then, add the files to a 'commit' like this:

![Commit]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/assets/images/gh-desktop-commit.PNG)

Once you are finished with this, you're ready to submit your changes. 

## Submitting Changes

To submit changes, click the "Push" button for changes on the top bar.
