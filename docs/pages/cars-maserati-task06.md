7. On the face of the steering wheel cover, apply three (3) pieces of double-sided foam tape in a square around the 1" hole.

9. Make sure that the push button base is aligned correctly with the push button. **Make sure that the button fits completely into the base.** There should be no space between the ring around the red button and the base when completely assembled.
10. When the push button base and the white tabs are properly aligned, tighten the white nut.
