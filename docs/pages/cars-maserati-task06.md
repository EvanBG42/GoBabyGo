_Note that this is only required for cars that will be operated by hand._

## Procedure

1. Locate the steering wheel that came with the car
2. Remove the 11 screws that hold the steering wheel cover to the steering wheel base and save the screws in the magnetic bin. There are 7 screws around the ring and 4 in the center hub.
3. Separate the front ring from the back part of the steering wheel. The two parts should look like those in the photo.<br>![Front and rear parts of the steering wheel]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task06-001.jpg)<br>The left is the rear view of the steering wheel cover. The right is the rear part of the steering wheel.<br>
4. Locate the large, red push button and:
	1.  Remove the switch from the bottom of the button by rotating it 1/8 turn counter-clockwise, and then pulling.
	2.  Set the switch in a safe location for later use.
	2.  Remove the white nut.
	3.  Be careful to keep the switch base ring together with the red push button.
4. Use a flat-tip screwdriver to remove the Maserati emblem that is stuck to the steering wheel cover.
5. On the large step-drill bit, locate the 1" diameter step and mark it with blue masking tape.
5. Mount the large step-drill bit in the drill. The drill and bit should look like the photo.<br>![Cordless drill with marked step-drill bit]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task06-002.jpg)
6. Position the steering wheel cover such that there is nothing below the emblem recess in the steering wheel cover so that you can drill through the center of the .
6. In the center of the emblem recess on the steering wheel cover:
	1. Use the drill to make a 1" diameter hole. 
	1. Test the hole size by inserting the threaded part of the push button. When the threaded part of the red push button can pass through the hole, you are finished drilling.
7. On the face of the steering wheel cover, apply three (3) pieces of double-sided foam tape in a square around the 1" hole.<br> ![Tape placement on the steeting wheel cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task06-003.jpg)
