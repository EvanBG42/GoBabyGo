Assemble the toggle switch assembly

## Procedure

1. Locate the 18-ga duplex wire and remove the silver foil shield from both ends.
2. Clip the bare wire at the end of the gray insulation.
3. On both ends of the 18-ga duplex wire, strip 1/2" of the insulation off of the end of each red and black wire. The photo shows how the duplex wire should look after you finish this step.<br>![Prepared cable assembly]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task10-001.jpg)
4. Locate the toggle switch and use the #2 Phillips screwdriver to loosen each of the screws on the terminals of the switch.
5. On one end of the 18-ga duplex wire, bend the exposed parts of the red and black wires around the shaft of the #1 Phillips screwdriver to form a "J" shape.<br>![Wire formed in a j-shape]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/maserati-task10-002.jpg)
6. To the terminal on the side of the switch marked "ON", attach the red wire to the screw terminal such that the insulated wire extends from the left side of the screw as shown in the preceding photo.
7. Use the #2 Phillips screwdriver to tighten the screw to hold the wire.
6. To the terminal on the side of the switch marked "OFF", attach the black wire to the screw terminal such that the wire extends from the left side of the screw.
7. Use the #2 Phillips screwdriver to tighten the screw to hold the wire.

## Verification

Use the multimeter to test the wiring.

1. On the multimeter, select "Ohms" (or continuity). This is usually indicated by the Greek letter omega (&#937;) for Ohms.<br>![Ohms setting on meter]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/metertest-ohms.jpg)
2. At the end of the 18-ga duplex wire that's not connected to the switch: 
	2. Place the red lead of the meter on the bare wire of the red wire.
	3. Place the black lead of the meter on the bare wire of the black wire.
4. With both leads touching their respective wires as shown in this photo <br>![Meter lead connection to bare wires]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/metertest-leads-bare.jpg)
	1. With the switch in the **OFF** position, the meter should not show continuity.<br>![Meter showing no continutity]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/metertest-open.jpg)
	2. With the switch in the **ON** position, the meter should indicate continuity (by showing zero or almost zero ohms or beeping).<br>![Meter showing continutity]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/metertest-short.jpg)

After you confirm that the wiring is correct with the multimeter, you can continue to [the next task]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/cars-maserati-task11.html).
