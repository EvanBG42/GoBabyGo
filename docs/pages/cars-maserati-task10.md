Assemble the toggle switch assembly

## Procedure

1. Locate the 18-ga duplex wire and remove the silver foil shield from both ends.
2. Clip the bare wire at the end of the gray insulation.
3. On both ends of the 18-ga duplex wire, strip 1/2" of the insulation off of the end of each red and black wire.
4. Locate the toggle switch and use the Phillips screwdriver to loosen each of the screws on the terminals of the switch.
5. On one end of the 18-ga duplex wire, bend the exposed parts of the red and black wires around the shaft of the Phillips screwdriver to form a "U" shape.
6. To the terminal of the switch marked "ON", attach the red wire to the screw terminal such that the wire extends from the left side of the screw.
7. Use the Phillips screwdriver to tighten the screw to hold the wire.
6. To the terminal of the switch marked "OFF", attach the black wire to the screw terminal such that the wire extends from the left side of the screw.
7. Use the Phillips screwdriver to tighten the screw to hold the wire.

## Verification

Use the multimeter to test the wiring.

1. Select "Ohms" (or continuity) on the meter.
2. At the end of the 18-ga duplex wire that's not connected to the switch: 
	2. Place the red lead of the meter on the bare wire of the red wire.
	3. Place the black lead of the meter on the bare wire of the black wire.
4. With both leads are touching their respective wires:
	1. With the switch in the OFF position, the meter should not show continuity.
	2. With the switch in the OFF position, the meter should indicate continuity (by showing zero or almost zero ohms or beeping).


After you confirm that the wiring is correct with the multimeter, you can continue to the [next task]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/cars-maserati-task11.html).
