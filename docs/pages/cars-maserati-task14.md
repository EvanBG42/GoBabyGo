### Preparation for next task

1. Verify the car's power switch on the dashboard is off.
2. Verify the toggle switch is off.
2. Disconnect the battery cable connector in the battery compartment and store the connector on the battery cable behind the battery.
3. Disconnect the dashboard connectors from the car.
