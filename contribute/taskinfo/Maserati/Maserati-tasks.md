	5. Locate the capacitor and then find the negative lead (it is the shorter of the two wires on the capacitor
	6. Twist the end of the long (+) lead of the capacitor together with the stripped end of the red wire. Only twist the bare wires.
	6. Use the crimp tool to crimp a red, female terminal to the twisted wires
	7. Twist the end of the short (-) lead of the capacitor together with the stripped end of the bkack wire. Only twist the bare wires.
	6. Use the crimp tool to crimp a red, female terminal to the twisted wires
	7. Test the connectors that you just attached by gently pulling on them. They should not slip off
8. On the other end of the 18-ga duplex wire, remove 1/4" of insulation from each of the red and the black wires
9. Twist the strands of each of the bare wires to keep them together. Do not twist the red and black wires together.
8. Locate the switch you removed from the push button
9. Bend the terminal closed to the black extrusion and bend it towards the black extrusion
10. Cover the bent terminal with black vinyl tape.
11. Connect the crimped terminal attached to the red wire to the metal terminal on the switch that is farthest from the black extrusion
12. Connect the crimped terminal attached to the black wire to the metal terminal that is next to the taped terminal.
13. Replace the switch in the push button by:
	1. Inserting the switch with the wires oriented along the center spoke of the steering wheel
	2. Orient the switch about 1/8 of a turn to the left of center
	3. Gently push the switch into the push button and rotate 1/8 of a turn clockwise.
